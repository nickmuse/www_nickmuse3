<p>Working with <a href="https://dev-dwarf.itch.io/">Noisy Bug Studios</a> to develop FEWAR-DVD was an experience that allowed me to contribute to one of my favorite pieces of art.</p>
<p>I helped implement the input system, the menus, the tech art (angular lighting, shockwaves, clouds, stars etc..) and my favorite; the novel spin effect that occurs as the player steers.</p>
<p>I learned a lot while working on thisâ€”thoughtful programming practices, source control, performance tuning, and, most valuably, going to release.</p>

<h2>my thoughts</h2>
<p>As a player, FEWAR resonates with me in several areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstract themes in sound, visual and lore.</li>
<li>Tight controls.</li>
<li>Progress explicitly through lessons learned from previous failures.</li>
<li>A feedback loop that plays to your curiosity of the unexplained.</li>
</ul>
